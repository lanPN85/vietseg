VietSeg
=======

A Vietnamese Word Segmentation program using Neural Network

## How to use:

- Download the source code

- Change to `src` folder

- Put a text file into `src` folder for segmenting, here I use `input.txt`

- Run `python3 main.py input.txt output.txt` (Yeah, this program use
Python3, and Python2 won't work on it, you can fix this, of course)

- Now you got `output.txt` which is segmented

## Performance:

Precision, Recall, and F1-measure in the same data as described 
in [this paper][10]:

    RESULT:
    ===================
    Run 0: P = 0.9156, R = 0.9294, F = 0.9225
    Run 1: P = 0.9015, R = 0.9183, F = 0.9099
    Run 2: P = 0.9189, R = 0.9327, F = 0.9258
    Run 3: P = 0.9208, R = 0.9339, F = 0.9273
    Run 4: P = 0.9166, R = 0.9295, F = 0.9230
    ===================
    Avg.   P = 0.9147, R = 0.9288, F = 0.9217


And here is the best performance in the [paper][10]:

    P = 94.00, R = 94.45, F = 94.23

The program use some random shuffers, so your result may not be the same 
as mine.

## Train the model yourself:

- Get the data (see links below) and put in the `dat` folder

- Change working directory to `src` folder

- Run `python3 word2vec.py` to get vectorized words for our segmenting model 
using Word2Vec library (Word2Vec itself is a neural network)

- Run `python3 learn.py` to really train the segmenting model

- Run `python3 performance.py` for examining the peformance of the model

- Now you can use `python3 main.py <input file> <output file>` as described above


## Data for training model:

- Vietnamese corpus:
    - File: [VNESEcorpus.txt][2]
    - Move the file to `dat` folder

- Vietnamese IOB training data:
    - File: [trainingdata.tar.gz][3]
    - Untar and put 10 files: test1.iob2 -> test5.iob2, train1.iob2 -> train5.iob2 to
    `dat` folder, along with `VNESEcorpus.txt`

## Future works:

- Speed up the network
- Use a professional deep learning package (Theano, Caffe, etc)
- Train the model with bigger corpus and training data file, like [these][9]
- Deal with uppercase characters
- Build a web app

## Acknowledgment:

This program use some code from [wendykan][4] and [mnielsen][5].
